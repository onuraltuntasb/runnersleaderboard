# RunnersLeaderboard

This project is made for job application (case study).
I chose React.js for frontend framework and I chose express.js for backend because 
these are the frameworks that I am most experienced and react is indispensable for real-time updated sites. First, I created this project
with firebase realtime db because its the fastest way to create small project then i thought that way was a bit tricky and 
was not showing my programming ability so I decided to use mySQL (support remote connect) db because,
you gave me csv files to use for data so I thought SQL is the most convenient way. I deployed mySQL db to heroku so you dont need to
setup mySQL or something else, project folder has mySQL remote config.
